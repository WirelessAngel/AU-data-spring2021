# [Contracting Diversity in Boston](https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2020/10/13/bostons-diversity-hiring-mandate-for-construction-projects-is-all-bark-no-bite)

## Clarity and Accuracy

I was able to identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate straight away (5). In fact, it was in the headline:
**Boston's Diversity Hiring Mandate For Construction Projects Is All Bark, No Bite**

There was no data visualization. Although, it might have been nice to see something like a pie chart showing the overall diversity of Boston compared with another pie chart showing the diversity of contractors.

The data was as accurate as they could collect (5). The reporters relied on data provided by the city committee in charge of enforcing this diversity hiring ordinance supplemented by data provided by the Black Exonomic Justice Institute. This was construction payroll data and everyone knows if you want to see the most up to date records, you follow the money.

The only problem I could see with this is if construction companies are fudging the payroll data. It might not be a problem in Boston. But, in certain cities in California, construction companies were known (over a decade ago now) to fudge payroll data to state they were paying x number of employees a fair amount when in reality they may be paying x+b number of employees the same amount as they should be playing x number of employees. Since those employees were hired illegally and paid under the table. Thus the contractor could have 15 people working for them for the price of seven.

It's hard to get data on schemes like this, though. Since both the employer and employees are engaging in this activity with the exrpess interest that it does not become public knowledge. Some good places to check into this would be rival contractors who have been shown to be transparent with their hiring practices. i.e. contractors that participate in employment verification programs. Also, local nonprofits may serve such communities.

The reporters provided their sources and made sure the readers knew where the information was coming from. Explanations were provided from a variety of sources and readers were not left lost as to what this all means.

## Quality

The story was executed with a high degree of quality (5). They grounded the story in their area and gave local context that allowed a reader/listener to follow along. The story was originally developed for audio. So, the statistics used were quick and to the point. They would give context with each statistic and let people mull it over before heading to the next set of information.

Good use of interviewees and statements from organizations. The piece was very much done in a style of "hedging your bets" or "all sides of a story presented" which NPR is known for, both famously and infamously. It worked in this case because the data speaks for itself (in the context that it was given). However, in more complex stories or where one side is simply stating falsehoods, such an approach could lead to readers giving both sides equal consideration. Which we found out is not good when one side is lying.

## Creativity

The piece was originally intended for a radio audience and it shows. There were no creative elements on the page to draw the reader in. (0)

# Story Pitch

##Media coverage in DC on American views: mapping interviewing diversity

Media coverage has long been criticized as focusing on a specific type of interviewee for stories. Usually this manifests in the *white rural American in a diner* interview that media orgs will turn to for commentary on a subject.

This of course does not reflect the diversity of America. And some in the media field (Celeste Headlee to name one outspoken critic) point to a lack of diversity in interviews after critically important events as a problem that needs to be addressed. So, how diverse is DC media coverage?

This piece would scrape articles from a list of top media orgs in the DC region for keywords that denote the diversity of those interviewed. Of course, there are many articles on people who hold power in DC or on celebrities. So, this piece would attempt to filter out all but those pieces which specifically are about how America is reacting to a key event or phenomenon. "DC residents think the lockdown measures have gone too far" and similar stories that give the implication that everyday citizens are the focus will be used in said report.

This story is timely since the US has a history of media coverage bias which organizations are now reckoning with. Black Lives Matter and the #MeToo movement have shaken things up and caused leaders to take a serious look at diversity in their workforce. Now public media reporters are demanding the same from their companies.

We can talk to the public radio employees that have banded together this month to [demand reform in their industry](https://twitter.com/CelesteHeadlee/status/1351263582038728708).

Here is a wideview example below. However, I would like to drill down to breakdown by publication, gender, and beat if possible.
