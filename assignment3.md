## Media coverage in DC on American views: mapping interviewing diversity

Media coverage has long been criticized as focusing on a specific type of interviewee for stories. Usually this manifests in the *white rural American in a diner* interview that media orgs will turn to for commentary on a subject.

This of course does not reflect the diversity of America. And some in the media field (Celeste Headlee to name one outspoken critic) point to a lack of diversity in interviews after critically important events as a problem that needs to be addressed. So, how diverse is DC media coverage?

This piece would scrape articles from a list of top media orgs in the DC region for keywords that denote the diversity of those interviewed. Of course, there are many articles on people who hold power in DC or on celebrities. So, this piece would attempt to filter out all but those pieces which specifically are about how America is reacting to a key event or phenomenon. "DC residents think the lockdown measures have gone too far" and similar stories that give the implication that everyday citizens are the focus will be used in said report.

This story is timely since the US has a history of media coverage bias which organizations are now reckoning with. Black Lives Matter and the #MeToo movement have shaken things up and caused leaders to take a serious look at diversity in their workforce. Now public media reporters are demanding the same from their companies.

We can talk to the public radio employees that have banded together this month to [demand reform in their industry](https://twitter.com/CelesteHeadlee/status/1351263582038728708).

## Collecting

Originally I was thinking we could write a program that could scrape for this information. It would be something like: search for "_ said" then search for identifying characteristics in the same paragraph as _ said. Now I realize what I should have sooner: race is not typically mentioned in a story unless it is relevant to what is being discussed. Election season had more identifiers for interviewing potential voters; but, even then stories often do not mention race unless it contributes to the story they are trying to tell. 
e.g. Trump is facing a steep climb when it comes to garnering Black votes. Taylor Green, a Black farmer living in Des Moines, has some thoughts on this.

For the chart below. I scanned through stories from five (5) DC publications looking for people who were either quoted or interviewed for a story. A data set - with many more stories scraped - would look something like this. Please see below the table for the stories used to collect the data and additional details.
